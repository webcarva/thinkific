# timing

I completed the basic specs in around 3 hours. In between Sunday chores I've come back to it and added a few other bits. Probably used the whole 6 hours by the end.

# given more time ...

* I don't have Photoshop on this machine but I'd convert the icons into a sprite for loading convenience.
* It's fully responsive but I think a new layout might be better for desktop
* I wanted to throw in some CSS animations while the music was playing but that would take some more time and I didn't want to let the result stray too far from the concept.
* As this a small component I've kept everything in the same less file but normally I'd extract and import e.g. colours, mixins and different/custom components
* As above for the JS, this could be more efficient if we used require.js but there's not much need for a single component.
* I've not really cross browser tested this yet. Would have liked to but just as an fyi I've been working in Chrome.

Any questions please let me know :)

PS the second track is my brothers band - enjoy!
